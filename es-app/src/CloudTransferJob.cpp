	//     again is a re-announcement and does not advance (ES announces
	//     SETTINGS before backuptool runs, then cloud_backup announces it

	//     n = the items counted before that script's first announcement
	//     + its n + the single-item phases ES chained after it (mTrailing).
	//     Until a script says, n is ES's estimate from the constructor; 0 is
	//     unknown and row 2 reads ITEM i alone. i never exceeds n on the
	//     page. A script whose i starts over, or that carries a count after
	//     one that did not, is a new script.
	//   ">>> doing <keyword>" -- what the item is busy with while rclone is
	//     not running yet. "archive": backuptool is writing the settings
	//     archive (its own output is discarded), and row 3 says so until the
	//     next per-file, checks or totals line, or the next unit. "unpack":
	//     the same tool putting one back. "scan" and "compare": cloud_scan
	//     checking the cloud and comparing its content (#350); "copy",
	//     "verify", "remove": the folder move's three steps (#353). Any
	//     other keyword is a newer script's and is ignored rather than
	//     shown raw.
	//   ">>> removed <files>|<bytes>|<per-system>" -- a match's summary, for
	//     the done page (below). A match cut off by the network prints it
	//     before exiting 69, so the page can say what had already gone.
	//   ">>> why <sentence>" -- a script saying, at the point of failure and
	//     in the player's words, what went wrong (D-UI-028). Attached to the
	//     unit it arrived under; before any unit, to the tier that reports
	//     next. The last one is the run's why for a command with no tiers.
	//   ">>> tier <label>|<rc>" -- GuiMenu's run composition reporting each
	//     of its parts as it ends (SAVES, ROMS AND BIOS, SETTINGS), so the
	//     done page can say which finished and which did not.
	//   ">>> offer <name>|<arg>|..." -- a question the script wants put to

// compares as it lists and moves what differs -- and a saves backup with
// one changed save among hundreds moves its bytes in a second, then spends
// the run comparing. Bytes alone pinned the bar at 100% over a live
// CHECKING 120 OF 400 FILES for all of it (review, 2026-09-08); the lower
// of the two reads 27 -> 0 -> 89 -> 100 block by block on that run, every
// number rclone's.
//
// The transfer's percentage is bytes: they say how long this will take when
// the files are a save game and a disc image. The count of files
// transferred stands in only when the bytes have no number (nothing but
// empty files queued), because it counts completed files -- four disc
// images moving in parallel read 0 / 4 until the first lands, and a bar
// that took the lowest of all three would sit at zero for most of such a
// run. A run with nothing to move has neither, and then the count of files
// checked is the only measure there is -- a true one, which is more than
// the spinner it replaces could say. Never a number nobody printed: with
// none, mPercent keeps its last real value. Called with mMutex held.
