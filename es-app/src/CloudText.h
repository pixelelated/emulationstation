// Nothing here reads a file, asks Settings or SystemConf anything, touches
// a Window, or measures a font, so all of it can be checked by a test
// binary that links no more of EmulationStation than this file and
// StringUtil (es-app/tests/unit). The callers keep the parts that cannot
// be: the file read, the translation of an outcome into the player's
// language, and the side effects a protocol line asks for.
//
// Translation stays outside on purpose. _() at this level would put the
// player's language inside the thing under test, so the enums below name
// an outcome and the caller says it in words.
